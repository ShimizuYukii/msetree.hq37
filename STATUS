Version 0.3-5  2000/01/29

More adjustments for API changes in R 0.99.0.


Version 0.3-4, 1999/07/21

Adjustments for R changes.


Version 0.3, 1998/11/14

Formulae of the form  use ~ . - estperf - name  are now accepted.

Explicitly enforces a maximum tree depth of 31 (forced by the way
integers are used to number nodes).

New functions tree.screen and tile.tree.


Version 0.2, 1998/07/08

More documentation added.

There is enhanced support for weighted tree fits.

snip.tree works around the limited identify in R.


Version 0.1, 1998/06/16

This is an experimental `clone' of the S tree function and a port
of my treefix library.  Function tree() behaves as the S version is
documented: in particular it will stop growing earlier than the S
version under some circumstances.

There is only documentation from treefix.
