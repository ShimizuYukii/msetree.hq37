Formulae of the form  use ~ . - estperf - name  are now accepted.

Explicitly enforces a maximum tree depth of 31 (forced by the way
integers are used to number nodes).

New functions tree.screen and tile.tree.

Version 0.1, 1998/06/16

This is an experimental `clone' of the S tree function and a port

documented: in particular it will stop growing earlier than the S
version under some circumstances.

There is only documentation from treefix.
